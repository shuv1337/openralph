# Ralph Custom Prompt Template

This is an example custom prompt file for Ralph. Copy this to `.ralph-prompt.md` and customize.

## Usage

Ralph will automatically read `.ralph-prompt.md` from your project root, or you can specify a custom path:

```bash
ralph --prompt-file ./my-custom-prompt.md
```

## Placeholders

- `{{PLAN_FILE}}` - Replaced with the plan file path (e.g., `plan.md`)
- `{plan}` - Also replaced with the plan file path (legacy format)

---

## Example Prompt

READ all of {{PLAN_FILE}}. Pick ONE task. If needed, verify via web/code search (this applies to packages, knowledge, deterministic data - NEVER VERIFY EDIT TOOLS WORKED OR THAT YOU COMMITED SOMETHING. BE PRAGMATIC ABOUT EVERYTHING). Complete task. Commit change (update the {{PLAN_FILE}} in the same commit). ONLY do one task unless GLARINGLY OBVIOUS steps should run together. Update {{PLAN_FILE}}. If you learn a critical operational detail, update AGENTS.md. When ALL tasks complete, create .ralph-done and exit. NEVER GIT PUSH. ONLY COMMIT.
